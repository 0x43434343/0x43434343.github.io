## Exercises 

1 - Add code to the sample DriverEntry to output The Windows OS version: major, minor and build number. Use the RtlGetVersion function to retrieve the information. Check the results with DebugView.


**Solution** 

```cpp
#include <ntddk.h>
#include <wdm.h> // for OS version

void SampleUnload(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject) {

	//Fahad this will execute when we stop the driver 
	KdPrint(("SampleUnload execute .... 1"));
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
	
}

void getVersion(RTL_OSVERSIONINFOW& os) {
	DbgPrint("getVersion get execute it");
	DbgPrint("The osvi.dwMajorVersion is: %u", os.dwMajorVersion);
	DbgPrint("The osvi.dwBuildNumber is: %u", os.dwBuildNumber);
	DbgPrint("The osvi.dwMinorVersion is: %u", os.dwMinorVersion);
}
extern "C" 
NTSTATUS
DriverEntry(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegisteryPath) // Fahad this we can called the main function 
{
	/* # DriverEntry will be called after driver loaded :D */

	// # DriverObject -> A pointer to a DRIVER_OBJECT structure that represents the driver's WDM driver object
	// # RegistryPath -> A pointer to a UNICODE_STRING structure that specifies the path to the driver's Parameters key in the registry

	//UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject); // Fahad , uses this to avoid error during the compilation
	//The reason to use UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER , cuz the argument should not leave it empty or the compiler will faill
	// and we don't need to use RegisteryPath yet ,  so the macro UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER will surve us in this station
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegisteryPath); // same the above;

	//The entry point for the driver's Unload routine, if any, which is set by the DriverEntry routine when the driver initializes. 
	//If a driver has no Unload routine, this member is NULL
	DriverObject->DriverUnload = SampleUnload;
	KdPrint(("DriverEntry execute it ... etc "));

	//NTSTATUS res;
	//Fahad -> The size in bytes of an RTL_OSVERSIONINFOW structure. This member must be set before the structure is used with RtlGetVersion.
	RTL_OSVERSIONINFOW osvi;
	osvi.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(RTL_OSVERSIONINFOW);
	NTSTATUS res;
	//assert(NT_SUCCESS(res));
	 res = RtlGetVersion(&osvi);
	
	 getVersion(osvi);

	return STATUS_SUCCESS;
